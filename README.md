This project may be repurposed for something similar in the future, perhaps a generic Unity game console.

Interactive C# Console (CSharpConsole)
=================

CSharpConsole is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program that creates a console in which you can enter C# code.
It's already pretty useful for debugging other plugins or just quickly testing something out.

A basic autocompletion feature has been implemented, but still needs quite a bit of work.

Ideas for future features include execution of external "script" files among other things.

Screenshots
